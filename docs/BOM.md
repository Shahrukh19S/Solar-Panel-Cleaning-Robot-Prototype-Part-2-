# Bill of Materials (BOM)

This is a starter BOM based on the **code** and the **wiring diagrams** in the repo. Update quantities/part numbers to match your exact build.

## Core electronics

- Arduino Mega 2560 (or compatible)
- 16x4 character LCD (HD44780 compatible)
- DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor module
- ACS712 current sensor module
- Voltage sensor module / resistor divider for battery/panel voltage
- Breadboard + jumper wires

## Power system (as shown in diagrams)

- Solar panel
- PWM solar charge controller
- 12V battery (sealed lead acid shown)
- DC-DC converter module (if required for 5V rail)
- Fuses / protection (recommended)

## Actuation (as shown in diagrams)

- DC motors (for robot movement)
- Motor drivers (IBT-2 / BTS7960 style modules shown)
- DC 12V water pump (shown)
- Relay module (shown)
- Tubing/nozzle/wiper assembly (mechanical)

## Optional / project-specific

- Mounting hardware, brackets, fasteners
- Enclosure for electronics
- Connectors (terminal blocks, JST, etc.)
